# Using Computer Vision to Detect and Monitor Climate and Insect-Induced Forest Damage from Satellite Imagery

This repository contains code and workflows from my CV4Ecology Workshop project, applying computer vision and remote sensing to detect and monitor drought, heat and bark beetle–induced forest damage in Arizona. It integrates NAIP high-resolution imagery, Sentinel-2 multispectral data, and USDA Forest Service aerial survey labels to classify healthy, infected, and dead trees, identify early stress indicators, and track infestation progression over time.
